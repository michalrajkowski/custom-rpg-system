# Quick Concept:

A roguelike tabletop RPG that supports permadeath and frequent character switching without breaking long-term campaigns or the feeling of character progression.

# Longer Description:

- The game is about being a weaker deity that wants to regain its power.
- You always have 2 character sheets: one for your god and one for your chosen human.
- The god is your main character. It has its domain and is immortal. You will level up your god with each session.
- Your chosen human is the character you play during the session. Half of their stats will be randomly determined (the stats the human had before being chosen), while the other half can be picked by the player and represent boons and powers gifted by the god.
- The human has to accomplish their own goals to level up. They can also complete the deity's goals to increase the deity's power.
- It is easy to die as a human, and <u>death is permanent</u>!
- There is a maximum level cap, and it is easy to reach (only a few sessions). After reaching the maximum level, the player can abandon the character, and it will live in the world as a powerful NPC. The Game Master MUST include the former player character in the world.
