# basic game playing mechanics/rules

- only d6 dices
- roll d6 to do tests
- leveling up/skills give more d6's
- counting the number of success.

(more precise)
### resolving skill tests
- Roll a number of d6 equal to your skill value plus any bonuses.
- Add up the total from all dice rolled.
- The GM rolls for the test difficulty the same way (e.g., if the difficulty is 3, the GM rolls 3d6 and sums the dice).
- The player succeeds if their total is higher than the difficulty score.
