There will be datasets from which the code for website / pdf generator will be able to create stuff
Datasets:
- names
    - pool of names tied to the "subclass"/class?
- traits
    - class tied
    - subclass tied
    - neutral
        - positive and negative
- skills
    - class / subclass / random(neutral)
- goals
    - class / subclass / random(neutral)

Plaintext file that will have classes and then quests with tags?
- For minor, medium, grand: +S, +M, +L

Generator will first try to generate from most specific, then from class specific then from neutral. (because sometimes there might not be certain things for subclass or even class)

# Subclassess
- each line starts "-" because it is then easier to paste them to other files

# Names
- this got generated with help of chatgpt
